You are running automated visual tests for Prototype P3 (Network & Space Syntax Analysis).

## Assignment
Test the P3 prototype at http://localhost:5173 using Playwright tests and visual screenshot examination.
Write results to /c/Users/johnc/collage-prototypes/test-results/TEST_RESULTS_P3.md

## Prerequisites
- Backend: http://localhost:8000 (verify with curl)
- Dev server: http://localhost:5173 (already running)
- Playwright installed at /c/Users/johnc/collage-prototypes/

## Step 1: Run Playwright Tests

```bash
cd /c/Users/johnc/collage-prototypes
npx playwright test --project=p3-network
```

Tests trigger extraction of Barcelona Eixample. Space syntax computation can take 30-60s.

## Step 2: Examine Screenshots

Read each PNG in /c/Users/johnc/collage-prototypes/test-results/screenshots/p3/.

Expected visuals:
- 01-map-loaded.png: Barcelona at zoom 14, flat (no pitch), sidebar on left
- 02-network-loaded.png: Colored street lines overlaid on map (viridis gradient)
- 03-metric-values.png: Network with centrality coloring, major streets warmer colors
- 04-network-stats.png: Sidebar showing topology stats (meshedness, dead-end ratio)

## Step 3: Check Key Values

From [P3-TEST] console output:
- Street count: >50 (expecting 200-2000)
- Centrality nodes: >0
- NAIN/NACH values: between 0 and 2.0
- Meshedness: 0.1-0.5 for Barcelona grid
- Dead-end ratio: 0.02-0.15

## Step 4: Write Results

Write /c/Users/johnc/collage-prototypes/test-results/TEST_RESULTS_P3.md:

```markdown
# P3 — Network Analysis Test Results
Date: YYYY-MM-DD

## Summary
| Test | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Map loads flat | PASS/FAIL | ... |
| Network extraction | PASS/FAIL | Streets: N, nodes: N |
| NAIN/NACH values valid | PASS/FAIL | Range: [min, max], mean: N |
| Network stats populated | PASS/FAIL | Meshedness: N |

## Network Metrics
| Metric | Value | Expected Range |
|--------|-------|----------------|
| Street count | N | 50-2000 |
| NAIN_800 mean | N | 0.5-0.9 |
| Meshedness | N | 0.1-0.5 |
| Dead-end ratio | N | 0.02-0.15 |

## Visual Assessment
(Describe each screenshot — especially street coloring patterns)

## Issues Found
## Recommendations
```

## Important Notes
- P3 uses flat (pitch=0) view — no 3D buildings, just colored street lines
- cityseer space syntax computation is CPU-intensive, may take a while
- Barcelona Eixample has a very regular grid, so NAIN values should be high
- neatnet street simplification should reduce edges by 58-95%
