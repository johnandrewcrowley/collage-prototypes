You are running automated visual tests for Prototype P5 (Urban Taxonomy — San Francisco).

## Assignment
Test the P5 prototype at http://localhost:5175 using Playwright tests and visual screenshot examination.
Write results to /c/Users/johnc/collage-prototypes/test-results/TEST_RESULTS_P5.md

## Prerequisites
- Backend: http://localhost:8000 (verify with curl)
- Dev server: http://localhost:5175 (already running)
- Playwright installed at /c/Users/johnc/collage-prototypes/

## Step 1: Run Playwright Tests

```bash
cd /c/Users/johnc/collage-prototypes
npx playwright test --project=p5-taxonomy
```

Record the output (pass/fail per test, timing, any errors).

## Step 2: Examine Screenshots

Read each PNG file in /c/Users/johnc/collage-prototypes/test-results/screenshots/p5/ using the Read tool.

For each screenshot, describe:
- What you see (map, colored cells, UI panels, legends)
- Whether it looks correct for a urban taxonomy visualization
- Any visual issues (blank canvas, missing data, broken UI)

Expected visuals:
- 01-map-loaded.png: San Francisco visible on a light basemap
- 02-data-loaded.png: Colored tessellation cells covering SF, status bar showing cell count
- 03-spacematrix-active.png: Cells colored by Spacematrix classification (greens/yellows dominate)
- 04-lcz-toggled.png: Different color pattern (blues/oranges for LCZ classes)
- 05-cluster-toggled.png: Different color pattern again (GMM cluster colors)

## Step 3: Check Test Output

From the Playwright console output, look for [P5-TEST] lines:
- Cell count should be >100,000 (expecting ~156,609)
- Load time should be <60 seconds
- Classification should switch between Spacematrix, LCZ, and Cluster

## Step 4: Write Results

Write /c/Users/johnc/collage-prototypes/test-results/TEST_RESULTS_P5.md with this structure:

```markdown
# P5 — Urban Taxonomy Test Results
Date: YYYY-MM-DD

## Summary
| Test | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Map loads | PASS/FAIL | ... |
| Data auto-loads | PASS/FAIL | Cell count: N, load time: Nms |
| Spacematrix active | PASS/FAIL | ... |
| Classification toggle | PASS/FAIL | ... |
| Load time acceptable | PASS/FAIL | ... |

## Benchmark Values
| Metric | Value | Expected | Status |
|--------|-------|----------|--------|
| Cell count | N | >100,000 | PASS/FAIL |
| Load time | Nms | <60,000ms | PASS/FAIL |

## Visual Assessment
### 01-map-loaded.png
(Describe what you see)

### 02-data-loaded.png
(Describe what you see)

(Continue for each screenshot)

## Issues Found
- (List any failures, visual problems, or concerns)

## Recommendations
- (Suggestions for fixes or improvements)
```

## Important Notes
- P5 auto-loads pre-extracted SF data — no extraction or backend call needed for data loading
- The data file is ~69 MB GeoJSON, so loading may take 10-30 seconds
- If Playwright tests fail due to timeout, increase wait times and retry
- If screenshots show blank canvas, note this as a SwiftShader rendering issue
- Be honest about what you see — report failures accurately
